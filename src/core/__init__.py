# NOTE FOR DEVS AND SOURCE READERS
# --------------------------------
#
# The osmata.py file in this directory originally belongs to the
# ospyata library.
# Since there were issues with dependencies before, the file has been
# downloaded on a Fedora 38 machine with the command:
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerocyber/ospyata/v3.1.4/src/ospyata/osmata.py

# As such, the version included here is from ospyata version 3.1.4
# And modifications may be done specifically for this version of Osmata as per need.
# The changes will be reflected in the upstream, but will not be as quick as in here.
